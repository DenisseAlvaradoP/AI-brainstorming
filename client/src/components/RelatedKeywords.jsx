// This code defines a React component called RelatedKeywords. It takes a prop called groupCode, which is expected to be used for fetching or displaying related keywords for a specific group chat. The component renders a heading and an unordered list, where the list items are placeholders for keywords that would be extracted and displayed later.
// The component is currently a static representation and does not include any logic for fetching or displaying actual keywords. It serves as a placeholder for future development where the keywords can be dynamically populated based on the groupCode or other criteria.
